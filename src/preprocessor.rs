//! Preprocessing module placeholder.
//!
//! Preprocessing is now handled directly by `libhook.so` during the build process,
//! so this Rust module does not currently expose any functionality.
//!
//! The module is intentionally kept as a placeholder to preserve the existing
//! module structure (`mod preprocessor;` in `main.rs`) and to provide a
//! well-defined location for any future Rust-based preprocessing logic.
